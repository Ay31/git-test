**On Smartphone Addiction**

Along with the coming of information era, smartphone has crept into our daily life and occupied all our scattered time. I have heard an adapted poetry, “The furthest distance in the world is not the distance between life and death. But when I stand in front of you, your eyes turn to your smartphone”. These lines poke fun at the group called “smartphone addicts”, who are totally addicted in the virtual world, turning a deaf ear to the world around.

Accustomed to the convenience brought about by the mobile phone, we cannot neglect the unfavorable consequences of smartphone addiction. For one thing, excessive dependence on mobile phone not only does harm to health but wastes a lot of time. For another, focusing on cellphone alienates our connection with our families and friends as well as weakens our communicative ability.

As far as I'm concerned, it is high time that we threw away the phone and raised our heads up. Do cherish everything around us and have a face-to-face talk with our relatives and friends. What's more, we should do more exercises and take part in real-life activities. Only when using the phone reasonably, can we realize the happiness of life.



nowdays,there has been growing awareness that xxx plays an important role in our daily life

on the one hand, since....,we are supposed to do xx ,people xxx , it is often the case that xxx,not only will, but also,so..that,thus xxxx

it  is time for us to xxxxx



**写作**

**还是那句话，切记不要去背千篇一律的模板，掌握固定表达，根据题目进行变化，拿的分数绝对比背模板的分数高很多！**

六级作文主要分为两类，一类是带漫画的，一类是直接给出话题。

第一类带漫画的要求先对漫画进行描述，然后引主题，之后做出结论

As is vividly shown in the cartoon，……

As the cartoon depicts，……

As is shown in the picture，……

……（先引出话题）.So just as the picture depicted/demonstrated,……

六级此类作文不是很常见，仅出现过一次，所以只要学会写第二类文章，如碰到第一类文章，前面加上对漫画的描述就可以了。

第二类是直接给出主题，然后发表观点，亮点是给出example。这一类作文写作的时候要学会用适当的方法引出题目中的名句。

As the proverb puts it，……

开头：我一般会用下面这个模版句（源自雅思Collin写作）百发百中。

1:Nowadays，there has been growing awareness that +对题目的转述+plays an important role in our daily life.

Eg:学生需要做课外活动吗？

改写：Nowadays，there has been growing awareness that doing after-class activities plays an important role in students’daily life.

Eg：学生需要独立自主嘛？

改写：Nowadays，there has been growing awareness that learning to be independent plays an important role in students ‘ daily life.

主体段

用两段表示就够了。

on one hand,+第一个观点。/First and foremost+第一种做法里面可以使用的转述句：

Since+原因，we are supposed to do(应该做）

Although +转折，we still need to do...

It is often the case that 用于举例子

on the other hand +第二个观点/Subsequently+第二种做法。

再用一两个简单倒装。

Not only will students relax themselves,but they will also make friends in this activity. 在这样的活动中，学生不仅能放松自己，还能在活动中交到朋友。

结尾段

！！！

不要再用in conclusion 啦

（使用 in a nutshell 简单又很高大上，也就是表达了总的说来的含义）

对结尾，我一般会套用几个模版

1it is time for us to do (是我们该做什么的时候啦）

2We need to bear in mind that......（我们应该牢记做什么）

3There is no better way to do than to do (做什么是什么的最好办法）

eg:there is no better way to be independent than to earn money on their own.(会独立的最好方法就是自己挣钱）



上面就是我给大家分享的模板，很短很简单，当然纸上谈兵光说不练怎么行？下面我以两年的六级真题为例子，来说一下这个模板到底怎么用。



Nowadays,there has been growing awareness that striking a balance between academic study and after-school activities plays an important role in students’ daily life.However,a great number of students are often caught up in a dilemma about how to achieve such a balance.In this essay,The approaches are illustrated as follows.（开头描述写作的目的，注意对题目中句子的转述，词汇的多样性，因为是“方法”类作文，以approaches引出后文）

First and foremost,I think that the most useful way is to increase students’ efficiency.Since both academic study and extra-curriculum play a necessary part in students’ personal development in such a modern society,it is inappropriate for students to give up either of them.If students are able to raise their efficiency well,not only will they learn a lot of theoretical knowledge through academic study,but they will also develop practical abilities through after-school activities,thus they will be more likely to become well-rounded generalists in the future.（提出第一个论点，注意使用了Since从句，if从句，倒装句,thus句）

Subsequently,students also need to learn to allocate their time wisely.For students,there’s no doubt that academic study should be given priority since academic performance determines whether they can get a decent job in the future.Although after-school activities benefit students’ development,they are only supplements to academic study.（提出第二个论点，注意使用there’s no doubt句型和Although句型）

In a nutshell,there is no better way for students to balance study and extra-curriculum activities than to manage their time better.（最后结尾高度概括,manage time同时包括前两个论点的含义，使用结尾常见模板。）



Nowadays, there has been growing awareness that mutual understanding and respect play an important role in interpersonal relationship.（开头点题，说明写作背景。）

on one hand, since different people have distinctive living backgrounds, it is often the case that they have different personalities. If people don't share mutual understanding and respect during communication, not only will they quarrel with each other easily, but also they will have bad mood, thus they will have particularly tense interpersonal relationship.（从反面说，如果人们不互相尊重理解，会怎么样）

On the other hand, in such a modern society, it is hard for people to achieve success without cooperation. If people share mutual understanding and respect during communication, they are more likely to have sound interpersonal relationship, which means they tend to achieve proficient collaboration more easily.（从正面说）



In a nutshell, there is no better way to have sound interpersonal relationship than to share mutual understanding and respect .（结尾简单明了）
